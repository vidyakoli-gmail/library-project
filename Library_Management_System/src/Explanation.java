public class Explanation {
//	This project is a console-based application that allows users to manage a collection of books in a library. 
//	It supports basic operations such as adding books, searching for books, and listing all books.
//	It demonstrates object-oriented programming, file handling, and basic data manipulation in Java.
//
//	Features:
//	Add a Book - Allows users to add a new book to the library with details like title, author, and ISBN.
//	Search for a Book - Allows users to search for a book by title or ISBN.
//	List All Books - Displays all books currently in the library.
//	Save and Load Data - Stores book information in a file and loads it on startup.
//	Technical Requirements:
//	Java SE (Standard Edition)
//	Basic knowledge of file I/O
//	Object-oriented programming (classes, objects, inheritance)
	
	
//	Additional Features to Consider:
//		Error handling for invalid input.
//		Enhancement of the user interface with more advanced text formatting.
//		Implementing a more complex data storage solution (e.g., using a database).
//		Key Concepts Demonstrated:
//		Object-Oriented Programming: Using classes and objects.
//		File I/O: Reading from and writing to files.
//		Data Structures: Using ArrayList and List.
//		Basic User Interaction: Handling user input and displaying output.
	
	
	
	
//	SUMURRY
//		This project is simple but covers essential Java concepts and can be expanded with more features 
//		if desired. It also provides a solid foundation for understanding Java's core libraries and file 
//		handling capabilities.
